# Aribtrage Autotrader

## Idea:
The trader figures out whether hedging a trade is relativly cheap.
That is, the trader will only buy ETF if shorting the Future seems cheap, more precisely the future seems to be overvalued. In this simple model we consider the Future to be overvalued if it's price is higer then the ETF price.

Similarly, the trader will only sell the ETF if buying the Future seems cheap.
